# Here we will rewrite the previous function to be destructive. This version must not just call the nondestructive 
# version from above and then clear and replace the values in the original list. Instead, you must traverse the list 
# once and make the changes to the list as you go. With that in mind, write the destructive function shortenLongRuns(
# L, k) that takes a list L and a positive integer k, and destructively modifies L by removing any values in L that 
# would otherwise produce a run of k consecutive equal values in L. 
# For example:
# L = [2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3] 
# shortenLongRuns(L, 2)
# assert(L == [2, 3, 5, 3])
# And: 
# L = [2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3]
# shortenLongRuns(L, 3)
# assert(L == [2, 3, 5, 5, 3])

def destructiveshortenlongruns(L, k):
	# Your code goes here
	l = []
	sum = 0
	for i in range(0,len(L)):
		if L[i] != L[i + 1]:
			if sum != k:
				l.append(L(i - 1))
			
			l.append(L(i))
		elif L[i] == l[i + 1]:
			sum = sum + 1
